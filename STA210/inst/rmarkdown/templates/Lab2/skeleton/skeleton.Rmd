## Question 1

### a

<!-- Fill in answer -->


### b

<!-- Fill in answer -->


## Question 2

```{r}
bikeshare <- bikeshare %>% 
  mutate(holiday.new = as.factor(
    case_when (
    holiday==0 ~ "non-holiday",
    holiday==1 ~ "holiday",
)
)
)
```

```{r}
# Use the glimpse() function to confirm that bikeshare contains the variable holiday.new.
```


## Question 3

### a

```{r}
# Graph the distributions of cnt for holidays versus non-holidays. 
```

### b

```{r}
# Calculate separate summary statistics to describe the distribution of cnt for holidays and non-holidays.

```

### c

<!-- Fill in answer -->


## Question 4

### a
```{r}
holiday <- bikeshare %>% filter(holiday.new=="holiday")
```

```{r}
#Create an object called non.holiday that includes only the days in the data set that were not holidays.
```

### b

```{r}
#Conduct a two-sample t ypothesis test to determine whether there is a significant difference in the average number of bike rentals on days that are holidays vs. those that are not. 
```

\color{black}

### c

```{r}
#Use the t.test() function to calculate a 99% confidence interval to estimate the mean difference in bike rentals on holidays vs. non-holidays.
```


### d

## Question 5

### a

```{r}
# Conduct an ANOVA test to determine whether there is a significant difference between the average number of bike rentals on holidays and non-holidays.
```
